SECW v1.4: The Update That Changed the World!

-- *New* Auto-Updates! --
From 1.4 forward, SECW will now support 1-Click Install and auto-updates! No longer do you have to worry about keeping your eyes peeled for updates! You'll be told when one releases, and it will be automatically installed!

-- Enhanced Gardens/Areas --
• Chao Garden has had minor changes to its geometry! All climbing points and loading zones have also been redone
• Hero Garden has been completely overhauled! It's now much bigger and on par with the quality of the other gardens! All climbing points and loading zones have also been redone!
• Dark Garden has been overhauled! The cauldron and graffiti make a much anticipated return! The tree has also been ported from the GCN garden, to add more life to this dead garden!
• The Dark Garden Ball has been moved from {0, 0} to {-61, 29} to reduce the chance of it being kicked into the pool
• Further edits have been made to the Black Market, it now renders 100% correctly
• All gardens have been re-exported, names of texture files have been moved into the lvl files and out of the dll
• All "Enhanced" areas now use vanilla texlists, except the Lobby
• Renamed all .sa2blvl files

-- *New* SECW Menu! --
Introducing, new in 1.4, the SECW Menu! This new, handy menu de-confuses many SECW features, & allows for more control over many others! Tired of button combos? Well fret no more! 
All combos are being retired & moved to the SECW Menu for easy access, and many options can now be configured in-game! Just press the back button on controller, or P (default) on keyboard, to open up
this new world of possibilities!

	• -- *New* Champ's ECW Market! --
	Inside the new Menu, you will find the ECW Market! Here you can buy Eggs, fruits, seeds, and masks directly from the garden! After tax and delivery fees, these do end up slightly more expensive than their BM counterparts, 
	but the convenience is worth it! Not to mention the items exclusively available, such as TT Shiny Eggs, and the GBA fruit! Just remember to thank Champ as he drops your items off, he is a good egg! 

	• -- *New* Teleport! --
	Inside the new SECW Menu's Toolbox, you can find the Teleport menu! Which at the press of a button will take you all across Chao World!
	
	• -- *New* Waypoint Visulizer! --
	Whether you're making your own mod, or are just curious, you can now enable the waypoint visualizer through the options menu! Orignally a seperate mod made by Exant, then locked away in SECW behind a dev toggle, it's now 
	available to all of you to use freely! The Waypoint menu allows you to toggle the visualizer, and move the waypoints up and down for easy viewing around hills and pits! Green means a ground waypoint, Blue means a water 
	waypoint, Red means another waypoint (either unused or an Animal Swim Aim waypoint), & black means no waypoint!
	
	• -- Autosave & Qucksave (SOD) --
	• Both have now been moved to the SECW Menu! Autosaving can now be adjusted and turned off via the Options menu, & the original button combo for Quicksaving (SOD) has been removed and is now activated in SECW's Main Menu!
	The Anti-cheat in place from 1.0 has now also been disabled, as the bug it was preventing has been patched!
	• Removed 2 minute Autosave timer option and added a 32 minute option

	
-- *New* Dynamic Classroom Chao --
Ever found the Classroom overly generic? Well find no more! Your Chao will now dynamically appear in the Classroom while in class! Their position is random too! How dynamic!
This option has two modes; Enabled & Only Player Chao
Enabled will just filter in your Chao as they enter, leaving it looking vanilla otherwise. Only Player Chao will leave the classroom empty until you enroll your Chao, and then show only your Chao! 
Sick of those generic Chao? Use this option!

-- *New* Enhanced Fruit Aging Mechanics --
In the vanilla game, fruit age up when you pause or leave the garden. When they reach an age of 9 (pausing or leaving 9 times), they rot and disappear from the garden.
If that sound broken to you, then SECW 1.4 has you covered! Fruit aging mechanics have been completely re-worked in this update to be based on time, rather than random actions!
*How it works!:*
Every 15 seconds you're in a garden, all fruit in that garden age by 1 (except normal, Garden Fruit; which age by 7). Once a fruit reaches an age of 240 or above, they rot and will vanish next time you 
enter the garden; this means Garden Fruit last around 9 minutes, while all other fruit last around an hour! 

-- *New* Enhanced Chao World Camera --
A brand new overhauld camera for Chao World allowing for analog input, vertical input, panning, freezing, and even options to invert the controls! It also comes with a Simple and Advanced mode: Simple 
handles panning for you, which is great for gameplay; while advanced leaves panning to you via the Z button/LShift key!

-- *New* Extra Garden Toys! --
You heard right! All toys can now spawn in all gardens! No longer does the Chao Garden have the most toys at 3, they all now have 5! They will appear as you unlock them for you Chao to enjoy! No matter 
their walk of life! If you use a custom/modded garden, and the toys spawn incorrectly, use the saftey option; this will disable spawns unless a garden specifically sets them (basically Enhanced only)

-- *New* Extra Chao Toys! --
The Dark and Hero rattles have been added to SECW! Which your Chao uses is based on their alignment:
-1.00 -> -0.33 = Dark Rattle; 
-0.33 ->  0.33 = Neutral Rattle; 
 0.33 ->  1.00 = Hero Rattle!
 
-- *New* Enhanced Chao Lobby --
The Lobby has finally got its enhanced makover for 1.4! While no significant difference has been made, all rendering issues have been fixed and the textures have been condensed into one file (ecw_stg_lobby_tex.pak)
This now means one texture file affects all versions of the Lobby! And that all versions of the Lobby are now affected by the config options in SECW! An all around great addition! 

-- *New* Chao Water Ripples --
That's right! Chao make ripples once again! Lost since the Dreamcast version, Chao used to make ripples as they swam, making the garden feel more alive and dynamic; but finally, after 20 years, 
the feature returns to SA2!

-- *New* Fly 2 Climb --
This ill named new feature allows Chao to transition to climbing from flying! If they hit a wall while in a climbing zone, they will latch onto the wall and begin scaling it! Rather that sliding their face against it!

-- *New* Disable Object Culling --
Enhanced Chao World's gardens have always ran into an issue where, at enough distance, the decorations will cull out. With the expansion of the Hero Garden, this became even more apparent. So! With this option enabled, 
culling is disabled for all garden objects! There may actually be a slight performance benefit from having this on!

-- *New* Skip Garden Transition --
Speeds up the garden transition so passing through garden gates is more snappy!

-- *New* DC Classroom Music --
The Classroom will continue to play the normal Kindergarten music, just like on Dreamcast! No more, oddly creepy, singing!
(This option will replaces the 'Disable Kindergarten SFX' option)

-- *New* SADC & SA2 Garden Trees --
More trees? You betcha! SADC have teleported all the way from 1998 to SECW 1.4! For 24 years old, they're looking mighty fine! And to top it off, the SA2 Dreamcast trees have also been resurected for 1.4! 
And both are selectable per garden, along with SADX trees!

-- *New* DC Tails Aniations --
Use the DC animations for Tails in the Chao gardens! Either only moving while holding something, or all his animations!

-- *New* Race Stagetitle & Japanese Stagetitles --
Finally, after 8+ updates, the Race Entrance finally has its HD Stagetitle! And to celebrate, I've made HD versions of the Japanese variants of all stagetitles too!

-- *New* Chao Shadow Shape --
Allows you to change the shape of the Chao Shadows! Options are 'DC-Like' & 'Round!' This option is also the toggle for the fixed shadow model!

-- *New* Chao World DJ v2! --
• Merged into the main mod and greatly expanded! No more limitations on music, and far more areas to chose from! Has own section in Config Menu!

-- *New* Emotive Chaos Eyes! --
Allows Chaos Chao's eyes to be more emotive by removing the strict SetEye lock on Chaos Types!

-- Random Egg Sets --
• No longer has an emblem requirement!
• Fixed an issue where 'Use Random Egg Sets' option was ignored, and defaulted to enabled

-- GCN Garden Titles & GBA Transporters --
• Merged into the Main mod, options added to the Config Menu!

• Better Chao Shadows has been merged for technical reasons, and to reduce the number of possibly confusing options
• The shadows of fruit will now dynamically change size depending on the size of the fruit! Meaning a more accurately sized shadow can now be used for all stages!
• Optimized the size calculator function

-- DC Transition Woosh --
• Additional option now slows down the transition speed, allowing for the full sound clip to play!
• DC Transition Woosh is no longer stuck on (this was due to the mod loader, not SECW. I just worked around it) 

-- Gentile Hat/Mask Removal --
• Now prints Menu Debug text when it fails, and why
• Now uses new SpawnChaoHat() function
• Mask will now match Chao's current rotation when removed

-- Textures --
