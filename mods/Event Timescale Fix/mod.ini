Description=Fix the timescale of two scenes to match with the intended lag of the Dreamcast hardware, that lag resulted in the game locking itself to 30FPS which make it play out at 0.5x normal speed, this makes Sonic's voice line no longer cut the police one in the English dub and match the DC timing of the ARK's collision.
