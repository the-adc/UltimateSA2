These are the fonts from previous versions, but at the moment they can't be loaded properly due to a few issues:
- They can't be loaded by the mod loader until there's a way to re-load the font, since it loads before the mod loader. Loading it right now just changes some text in Chao World.
- They have several spacing issues due to changes made for the replacement font.

Replace efmsgfont_ascii24S in resources\gd_PC with the file of your choice:
efmsgfont_ascii24S_BACKUP: The vanilla font.
efmsgfont_ascii24S_ComicSans: SA2 English/French/German/Spanish font
efmsgfont_ascii24S_ComicSansEdited: Comic Sans edited to minimize spacing issues.
efmsgfont_ascii24S_ComicSansEdit+Filtered: Comic Sans edited + filtered for smoother appearance.
efmsgfont_ascii24S_Impress: SA2 Japanese/SA1 English font

Replace efmsgfont_ascii24S in resources\gd_PC. The vanilla font has also been provided as a back up.
